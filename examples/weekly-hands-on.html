    <strong>5 things we did well:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Participation: the team participated actively in slack and team meetings
      </li>
      <li>
        Resolved CORS issue, I worked with Cassandra to resolve the CORS issue
        that was blocking progress
      </li>
      <li>
        Daily Stand Up, we decided to keep the stand up to a minimum and for the
        members that could not attend to post theirs in slack so everyone is on
        the same page
      </li>
      <li>
        Instructor helped with the nasty bug we have running the back end, we'll
        reach out sooner next time
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>3 things that did not go well</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Style framework (material-ui) was not able to make the page layout that
        we were expecting, we should check for the features we want before
        choosing things like that
      </li>
      <li>
        Didn't reach out for help soon enough, spent too much time researching
        issues instead of asking for help
      </li>
      <li>
        Cassandra posts too many memes to the channel, decided to reduce the
        clutter and stop doing that
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Shout Outs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cassandra, even though the memes were distracting she is focused on
        keeping the team motivated
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>What did the team learn?</strong><br />
    Ask for help sooner instead of waiting until the last minute. We can even
    ask while still doing research because it seems that responses can take
    several hours.
    <br />
    <strong>What did I learn?</strong>
    React is hard! I was building large components instead of breaking them down
    smaller. This made it harder for anyone else to understand what the
    components I made were doing.
